# Cappuccino Instructions
- Place each command in a separate Python file under the `commands/` directory instead of `bot.py`.
- Add the bot token to `.env` using the key `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.  Provide an example value in `.env.example`.
- Include `SUPPORT_SERVER_URL` and `BOT_INVITE_URL` in `.env.example` and replace them with real values in `.env`.
- Focus on music and utility commands only; text to speech functionality has been removed.
